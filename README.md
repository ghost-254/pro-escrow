## üîë Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project (or use your preferred method for handling environment variables). Include the following variables (example for Firebase-based project):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id

# Add any other required environment variables here
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_payment_gateway_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
```

> **Note**:  
> - **NEVER** commit your real credentials to version control.  
> - Use environment variables in your serverless functions or Next.js API routes as needed.  
> - If deploying to a service like Vercel, set these variables in your project‚Äôs settings.

## ‚úÖ Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: For testing individual components and functions, use a testing framework like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).  
2. **Integration Tests**: To test interactions between components or services, consider [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).  
3. **End-to-End Tests**: For simulating user behavior across the entire app, use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).  

Typical steps to run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
or
```bash
yarn test
```

## üö¢ Deployment

**Recommended**: Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (official hosting platform for Next.js).  

1. **Install the Vercel CLI** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```
2. **Initialize your project**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
3. **Set environment variables** in your Vercel dashboard.  
4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```
   or use Vercel‚Äôs GitHub integration for automatic deployments on push.

**Alternative Hosts**:  
- **Firebase Hosting**: If you‚Äôre already using Firebase for authentication and functions, you can also use Firebase Hosting.  
- **AWS or Azure**: Set up your build pipeline and environment variables.  
- **Docker**: Create a Dockerfile and run your container in any compatible environment.
